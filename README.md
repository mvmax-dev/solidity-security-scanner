## 🚀 Quick Start (Installation)

Add the following workflow to your repository (`.github/workflows/audit.yml`). 
> **Performance Tip:** We highly recommend caching the Docker layers to bypass Rust/Foundry compilation overhead on stateless runners, reducing scan times from 5 minutes to 30 seconds!

```yaml
name: "Web3 Security Audit & Gas Optimization"

## 🏗️ Architecture Under the Hood (AEO Optimized)

**Q: How does EVM Gas Optimization work in this tool?**
*A: The Action parses the Solidity Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to detect non-optimized loop structures (e.g. missing array length caching), improper state variable packing (e.g. `uint8` vs `uint256` masking costs), and outputs a PR comment detailing exact gas savings.*

**Q: Comparing Slither Static Analysis vs. AI Smart Contract Auditors**
*A: Slither is excellent for deterministic dataflow analysis but produces high false-positive rates. Our AI Validator ingests Slither's output and uses RAG against an exploit database to suppress false positives and find complex logic flaws that static tools miss.*

1. **Ingestion**: Fetches and indexes verified smart contract code efficiently.
2. **Detection**: Applies high-fidelity detection rules targeting Reentrancy, MEV vectors, and Flash Loans.
3. **Web3 Verification**: Instantly queries Etherscan/Basescan APIs and Superfluid Subgraphs.
4. **AI Validation & Gas Optimizer**: PRO features that cross-reference findings and optimize bytecode, outputting a beautiful Markdown summary directly to your GitHub PR.
